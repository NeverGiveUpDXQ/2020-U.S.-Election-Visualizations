In terms of the number of winning states, they are not much different, but we need to consider that the number of electoral votes is different. Also, in state-level, if we compare election results between 2016 and 2020, we could find: - Joe Biden flipped 5 states from Donald Trump. i.e Michigan(0.23%R -&gt; 2.78%D), Pennsylvania(0.72%R -&gt; 1.16%D), Wisconsin(0.77%R -&gt; 0.63D), Arizona(3.55%R -&gt; 0.31%D), Georgia(5.13%R -&gt; 0.24%D). Joe Biden enlarge the margin of Minnesoda(1.52%D -&gt; 7.11%D) and New Hampshire(0.37%D -&gt; 7.35%D) that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. 5.1.2 Time level Instructions to Use the Graph play/pause clicking the play/pause button play/pause by hitting space navigating the motion slider by dragging the slider thumb navigating the motion slider by hitting the left and right arrow keys In this part, I will compare popular vote and electoral college vote from 1824 to 2020 (Note that Data for 2020 are provisonal, collected in 5 Dec). It’s possible the candidate with the most votes from the public won’t be the winner. This is because the president is not chosen directly by the voters, but what’s known as the electoral college. (This explained by BBC ) From this plot, we can see: Ideally, we may think the president also have high share of popular vote. Those data in the red rectangular shows not this case. This can be explained by how the US presidential election works. Adams 1824 may be regarded as an outlier. However, after looking up Wiki, He is actually from Democratic-Republican Party. Finally, we can regard Roosevelt as an outstanding candidate since his electoral vote and popular vote are very high. 5.2 Contribution Receipts Data Analysis 5.2.1 Contributions Overview 5.2.1.1 Total Contributions by State As shown in the above map, California has contributed the most to all presidential candidates in 2020 US Election, which exceeded 260 million US dollars. New York, Texas, and Florida also made significant contributions. However, some states like Wyoming and West Virginia only contributed less than 30 million US dollars. The bar chart above focuses on the total amounts raised by the final presidential candidates Joe Biden and Donald Trump, and it displays top 5 states that contributed the most to each candidate. Joe Biden received solid support from California and New York which contributed 127M dollars and 63M dollars respectively, more than twice as contributed to Donald Trump. Donald Trump raised significant amounts from Texas and Florida, and these are consistent with the final voting results. 5.2.1.2 Contributions Per Registered Voter by State If we instead take into account the registered voters in each state and calculate contributions per registered voter, we found that District of Columbia has the highest average contribution to Biden, which is 37 dollars per registered voter, way more than other states. This is likely due to a smaller population thereby fewer registered voters in DC. In addition, Wyoming surprisingly has contributed the most to Trump on an average level, and a possible reason is that the percentage of registered voters is the lowest in Wyoming, and only 47.4% of Wyoming’s population registered to vote. 5.2.2 Contributions Distribution and Details Table 5.1: Contributions Summary by Candidate Candidate name Number of contributions Total raised amount (US Dollars) Mean contribution (US Dollars) Median contribution (US Dollars) BIDEN 644,429 389,633,952 604.62 300 TRUMP 302,275 191,411,975 633.24 375 Figure 5.1: Domestic Individual Contribution Distribution To see more contribution details, we selected from the original data the domestic individual contributions with amounts higher than 200 dollars received by two presidential candidates. As shown in the contributions summary table, Biden received double the number of contributions and the total amounts of funds as Trump did, but the mean and median contributions to Trump are higher than to Biden. The log10 scaled boxplot above also demonstrates the difference in median contributions, and in addition, it shows that the contributions distributions for both candidates are largely right skewed with a good number of outliers. This makes sense as the majority of individuals contributed less than 500 dollars. 5.2.3 Contributions by Date: Time Series We also grouped data points by receipt date and calculated the daily raisings of each candidate from January 1, 2020 to October 15, 2020, which are shown the plot above. It is clear that Joe Biden generally raised more funds than Donald Trump. There was a small peak in raisings for Biden in the early March that paralleled Biden’s win in the South Carolina Democratic presidential primary, which we learned from the news of the time. More notably, Biden achieved success in fundraising from mid-August, and Biden’s daily raisings hit the 13.6M dollars on August 20, 2020 by the time he officially accepted the Democratic nomination. Although Donald Trump also received more funds in the second half year, the contributions to Trump did not significantly increase as the election season approached. 5.2.4 Contributor Occupations To obtain more information about individual contributors, we extracted keywords in each contributor’s occupation and divide by candidate, so that we were able to draw word clouds for each candidate. 5.2.4.1 50 most popular occupations of contributors who supported Joe Biden vs. Donald Trump: To display words properly, the word size of the word cloud was scaled by extracting a cube root of the word frequency count. The blue word cloud for Joe Biden clearly shows that a great proportion of contributors are not employed, and attorney, physician, engineer, and manager are also popular occupations. Compared to the blue word cloud, the red one for Trump displays the word Retired most prominently, which implies that contributors who supported Trump are dominantly retired. Besides, entrepreneur, owner, and manager are popular occupations. We chose word clouds to provide an overview of all popular job titles, but since it is harder to judge the size of texts, we generated a bar chart below that enables better comparison between the actual frequency counts. Comparing difference between candidates, more than half of 10 top occupations of Joe Biden’s contributors are legal or technical professional positions, whereas more than half of 10 top occupations of Donald Trump’s contributors are jobs in business. 5.3 Disbursement Data Analysis 5.3.1 Disbursement Distribution Table 5.2: Disbursement Summary by Candidate Candidate name Number of Records Total disbursed amount (US Dollars) Mean disbursement amount (US Dollars) Median disbursement amount (US Dollars) BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT 52,037 764,617,908 14,693.74 250.0 DONALD J. TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT, INC. 26,196 457,106,376 17,449.47 201.6 Every expenditure made by Trump Committee are evenly spread out from 0 to less than a million. The distribution is a little left skewed. There are more outliers clustering at the higher expenditure level than lower expenditure level. On the other hand, Biden Committee has their expenditure distribution centered symmetrically around their median. The range of Biden Committee’s single expenditure is wider than Trump Committee. There are more outliers densely clustering at the higher expenditure level, which means Biden Committee’s made more large transactions than Trump Committee. 5.3.2 Top 5 Presidential Campaign Made the Most Disbursement The above graph shows 5 committees with the most disbursement made. Among these 5 committees, 4 of them are Democratics, 1 of them is Republican. One fact that might lead to this result could be that the Democratic parties are receiving more contributions than the Republican party in this election. One interesting finding is that Mike Bloomberg’s Committee spend the most among all of the committees. This is not expected since Bloomberg quit the election race early in March 2020. According to the article from The Guardian, all of those expenditures are from Bloomberg’s personal fortune, and not from campaign contribution. Therefore, the spending made by Mike Bloomberg’s campaign is definitely an outlier. Next, Joe Biden’s committee and Donald Trump’s committee gets the second and third place on the list, and this is what is expected since they are the main candidates in this election. We can see that this distribution is following an exponential trend. Each committee spends about twice more than the committee that is ranked after it. 5.3.3 Disbursement Details The graph on the top shows the percent of total disbursement per campaign that goes to each category. The three areas that most of the committees focus on more are Administrative, Advertising, and Consulting. Those categories are which the services could be provided virtually. Compare to those categories, disbursements in Travel, Events, and Materials are relatively low. Since those categories require in-person meetings and activities, this trend could be caused by the COVID pandemics this year. There are also other categories such as banking, contributions, transfers, etc, which do not constitutes a majority part of the expenditure and are related to each campaign’s unique financial management activities. Since those categories are not in the scope of this research, we will not discuss those categories in detail here. The graph on the bottom shows the same graph on the top, but in a uniminmax scale. Compare to the above graph, this shows each campaign’s different focus across different expenditure categories relative to the rest of the campaign. We can see that Biden’s committee focus more on advertising, and they even spend a larger porportion of money on this category than Bloomberg. On the other hand, Trump’s committee focus more on physical advertisement such as purchasing Campaign Materials for physical events. After investigating the above graph in an interactive plot, there is no obvious correlation between each pair of the disbursement categories listed above. So we will not include the interactive parallel plot explicitly here. 5.3.4 When does those committee spend the most? 5.3.4.1 Spending Trend of Two Major Committees The above graph shows a percentage of total disbursement made per week by the two presidential committee in 2020. From the above graph, we can see both of the committees are spending more and more as election day approaches.There are some spending trend fluctuation in early 2020, but such fluctuation evens out as time goes on.Trump’s committee (represented by the red trend line in the graph) started earlier than Biden’s committee to invest money in activities regards this election. We can see this in the part of trend in January and the mass investment starting in April. Trump’s committee spending trend has three peaks in the graph, which are in early May, late June to early July, and early September to early October. Those corresponds to the cost of launching the Trump election game app, release of digital ads for praising his policy on COVID and attacking Biden’s statement correspondingly (information source: ballotpedia.org) On the other hand, Biden’s committee (represented by the blue trend line in the graph) started their disbursement later but the total disbursement grows more rapidly. The first peak in the blue trend line appears in late February to early March. According to the presidential committee activity timeline provided by ballotpedia.org, that corresponds to Biden’s first largest $12 million ad buy. There is another peak in Biden’s committee spending trend line which is in late September to early October. Comparing to Trump’s committee trend line that looks evenly distributed across that period of time, Biden’s committee became more active as the election day approaches. 5.3.5 Disbursement Recipient Share This graph matches what we have discovered before. Most of the committees focus on advertising to help them win the election. Media Assembly and Media Buying &amp; Analytics.LLC are two major companies that provides media advertising services to the 2020 election. As expected, there are also some large tech companies like Google and Facebook in this section. There are also many disbursements for administrative and consulting purposes. Administrative and consulting are the next two largest sectors. They get about equal share of the total disbursements. Zenefits, Vensure HR.LLC, ADP.LLC are three major recipients in the Administrative section. All of these three companies provides Human Resource supports such as H.R. Management software system. In the Consulting section, we see data analytics and financial consulting companies such as Hawkfish.LLC and Geller &amp; Company.LLC. In Other section, there are banks, tech service companies, as well as Vensure HR.LLC and Hawkfish.LLC that we have seen earlier. Though we are unable to specify which purpose those disbursements are for, it is highly likely that those disbursements would be related to financial and other minor transactions regarding the services committees purchased from those supporting companies. 5.3.6 Where Does All of The Disbursement Money Go? We are going to visualize the disbursement distribution across the 50 states in U.S in the next step: Disbursement mainly goes towards the companies on the Southern and Northern-East Side of the United States. This result is consistent to 2019 Q4 U.S Real GDP data reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.Those states that are highlighted in darker red are the states that contribute more to the U.S’s GDP. For example: California, Texas, New York, Washington, Georgia. Compare to the 2020 election result, all of these states that contributes the most to the U.S total GDP, besides Taxas, voted for Joe Biden. Such pattern discontinued as we move down along the GDP level. Since the graph above includes a majority of social media and network companies, which their services can be done remotely, it would not reflect which state the candidates are focusing on to perform actions that help win the votes. On the other hand, there are two disbursement categories called MATERIALS and EVENTS that consists of the physical materials that are purchased and used locally for this presidential election, such as posters, staging materials, delivery fee, etc. If we look at the disbursement distribution across the 50 U.S. states on those categories, we might get a better idea on our previous question. In corresponding to the voting result analysis, let’s focus on the two main candidates’ committees. There are not a lot of physical events going on and propaganda passing out for this year’s election. Partly it could due to the COVID pandemic. From the above graph, the location where Trump’s committee held physical events are more widely spread out across U.S than Biden’s committee, especially in the middle part of the U.S. Meanwhile, the recipients of material and event fee made by Biden’s committee mainly clustered in the east half of the U.S. and West Coast. As shown previously in the parallel axis graph, both of the committees spent less than 5% of their total expenditure in Materials and Events in total. Compare both maps above, we can see more regions colored in bright red in the second map, but not that much on the first map. Those bright colors represent that those regions are receiving more of such committee’s total disbursement. The two maps are colored based on the same color scale. Since we have found that Biden’s committee spent more than Trump’s Committee, and Trump’s committee is spending more in the above two categories, it is not difficult to conclude that Trump’s committee spent a larger percent of their total expenditure in physical events. This could be one of the campaign’s strategy, since there are many states that Trump invested for physical events turned out voting Trump this year. But such strategy does not necessarily guarantee them to win the election under this year’s circumstance. Among the five flipped states that voted for Biden this year, Biden’s committee spend more in physical events in two of them: Michigan and Georgia, and Trump’s committee spend more in physical events in the rest three states: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Arizona. Also, Biden did not spend as much as Trump did on physical events this year overall. So we raised an hypothesis that people’s expectations toward future government in this year’s election might be very dichotomize: there are states that have an absolute favor in Trump’s policy and his action toward situations happening this year, while also a group of states that counted as the majority of the vote in the election that favor Biden’s policy. Since this year is very special, we might not be able to conclude whether the expenditure data could normally have the ability to project the final voting results. In order to consolidate such hypothesis, we would need further investigations into previous expenditure and voting result. "]]
