TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT, INC. 26,196 457,106,376 17,449.47 201.6 Every expenditure made by Trump Committee are evenly spread out from 0 to less than a million. The distribution is a little left skewed. There are more outliers clustering at the higher expenditure level than lower expenditure level. On the other hand, Biden Committee has their expenditure distribution centered symmetrically around their median. The range of Biden Committee’s single expenditure is wider than Trump Committee. There are more outliers clustering at the higher expenditure level, which means Biden Committee’s made more large transactions than Trump Committee. 5.2.2 Top 15 Presidential Campaign Made the Most Disbursement The above graph shows 15 committees with the most disbursement made. Among these 15 committees, 10 of them are Democrates, 2 of them are Republicans, and 2 of them are Independent, 1 of them is Libertarian. One interesting finding is that Mike Bloomberg’s Committee spend the most among all of the committees. This is not expected since Bloomberg quit the election race early in March 2020. Joe Biden’s committee and Donald Trump’s committee gets the second and third place on the list, and this is what is expected since they are the main candidates in this election. We can see that this distribution is following an exponential trend. Each committee spends twice more than the committee that is ranked after it. 5.2.3 Disbursement Details The three areas that most of the committees focus on are Administrative, Advertising, and Consulting. Those categories are which the services could be provided virtually. Compare to those categories, disbursements in Travel, Events, and Materials are relatively low. Since those categories require in-person meetings and activities, this trend could be caused by the COVID pandemics this year. After investigating the above graph in an interactive plot, there is no obvious correlation between each pair of the disbursement categories listed above. So we will not include the interactive parallel plot explicitly here. 5.2.4 When does those committee spend the most? 5.2.4.1 Spending Trend of Two Major Committees From the above graph, we can see both of the committees are spending more and more as election day approaches.Th ere are some spending trend fluctuation in early 2020, but such fluctuation evens out as time goes on. Trump’s committee started earlier than Biden’s committee to invest money in activities regards this election. We can see this in the part of trend in January and the mass investment starting in April. Trump’s committee spending trend has three peaks in the graph, which are in January, late May to early July, and late September to early October. On the other hand, Biden’s committee started their disbursement later but the total disbursement grows more rapidly. There are two obvious peak in Biden’s committee’s spending trend line, which are in May and late September to early October. 5.2.5 Disbursement Recipient Share This graph matches what we have discovered before. Most of the committees focus on advertising to help them win the election. Media Assembly and Media Buying &amp; Analytics.LLC are two major companies that provides media advertising services to the 2020 election. As expected, there are also some large tech companies like Google and Facebook in this section. There are also many disbursements for administrative and consulting purposes. Administrative and consulting are the next two largest sectors. They get about equal share of the total disbursements. Zenefits, Vensure HR.LLC, ADP.LLC are three major recipients in the Administrative section. All of these three companies provides Human Resource supports such as H.R. Management software system. In the Consulting section, we see data analytics and financial consulting companies such as Hawkfish.LLC and Geller &amp; Company.LLC. In Other section, there are banks, tech service companies, as well as Vensure HR.LLC and Hawkfish.LLC that we have seen earlier. Though we are unable to specify which purpose those disbursements are for, it is highly likely that those disbursements would be related to financial and other minor transactions regarding the services committees purchased from those supporting companies. 5.2.6 Where Does All of The Disbursement Money Go? We are going to visualize the disbursement distribution across the 50 states in U.S in the next step: Disbursement mainly goes towards the companies on the Southern and Northern-East Side of the United States. This result is consistent to 2019 Q4 U.S Real GDP data reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.Those states that are highlighted in dark blue are the states that contribute the most to the U.S’s GDP. Compare to the 2020 election result, all of these states that contributes the most to the U.S total GDP, besides Taxas, voted for Joe Biden. Such pattern discontinued as we move down along the GDP level. Since the graph above includes a majority of social media and network companies, which their services can be done remotely, it would not reflect which state the candidates are focusing on to perform actions that help win the votes. On the other hand, there are two disbursement categories called MATERIALS and EVENTS that consists of the physical materials that are purchased and used locally for this presidential election, such as posters, staging materials, delivery fee, etc. If we look at the disbursement distribution across the 50 U.S. states on those categories, we might get a better idea on our previous question. In corresponding to the voting result analysis, let’s focus on the two main candidates’ committees. There are not a lot of physical events going on and propaganda passing out for this year’s election. Partly it could due to the COVID pandemic. From the above graph, the location where Trump’s committee held physical events are more widely spread out across U.S than Biden’s committee, while the recipients of material and event fee made by Biden’s committee mainly clustered in the east half of the U.S. and West Coast. As shown previously in the parallel axis graph, both of the committees spent less than 1% of their total expenditure in Materials and Events. Compare both maps above, we can see some regions colored in bright green and blue in the map on the right hand side, but not the map on the left hand side. Those bright colors represent that those regions are receiving more of such committee’s total disbursement. The two maps are colored based on the same color scale. Since we have found that Biden’s committee spent more than Trump’s Committee, and Trump’s committee is spending more in the above two areas, it is not difficult to conclude that Trump’s committee spent a larger percent of their total expenditure in physical events. This could be one of the campaign’s strategy. Also, Trump’s committee is spending significantly more on some of the states where they win compare to the expenditure of Biden’s committee on those states. There is such a trend in the election result this year, but to answer whether there is truly a correlation between expenditure and the voting results would need further investigations on more data sets from previous years.
