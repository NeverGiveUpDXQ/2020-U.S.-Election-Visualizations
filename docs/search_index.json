[["index.html", "2020 U.S. Presidential Election Exploration Chapter 1 Introduction", " 2020 U.S. Presidential Election Exploration GROUP 10: Jin Qian, Wenjie Zhu, Yibai Liu 2020-12-17 Chapter 1 Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic being the most consequential global event in the year of 2020 has impacted everyone and every country in the world, and it has also shaped every facet of the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election. In an environment of continued uncertainty, states changed their rules of voting with the objective of arranging COVID-safe elections, but the surge in absentee/mail-in ballots has inevitably extended the post-election vote counting in some states. This issue aroused continued disputes over the election integrity in the two weeks until the Associated Press finally called Joe Biden the winner of the presidential race. Donald Trump and his proxies repeatedly attacked mail voting and sowed doubts on the process and made conspiratorial claims of voting fraud, saying the election was “stolen”. Although these claims have been proven false and baseless by voting officials in both parties, we were still curious about if there exists other evidence that has provided hints of Biden’s win. Some case studies and analysis have discussed how the US economic conditions, the racial unrest, and Trump’s response to COVID-19 have impacted the odds of Trump being reelected, but we chose to focus on the public funding of the presidential election, and see if the raisings and spendings of election campaigns were linked to determining the winner of 2020 U.S. Presidential Election. In the project, we collected the voting data from Harvard Dataverse, The Cook Political Report, FOX News as well as the presidential election committee contribution receipts and disbursements data from Federal Election Commission to generate visualizations and conduct investigations on the relationships between campaign finance and election results. We would like to carry out analysis from both geographic and time series perspectives and answer the following questions: Is there anything surprising about the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election results? How much has presidential election committees raised and spent this year? Did contributions reflect the expectations and choices of people of the United States? What were each campaign’s spending strategies and how effective were those strategies in leading the election? In the following chapters, we will discuss these questions and provide some new insights on forecasting the election outcomes.

Cook Political gathered and reported the 2020 election state-level popular vote share between the two major presidential candidates: Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Harvard Dataverse archived the state-level voting outcomes across candidates from 1976 to 2016. FEC gathers and processes campaign finance data and discloses information about the public funding of US presidential elections. From the above data sources, we collected and used four major datasets: 1976-2016 Presidential Election Results from Harvard Dataverse, 2020 Presidential Election Results dataset from Cook Political, as well as the Contribution Receipts dataset and the Campaign Disbursements dataset from FEC. Each member on our team was responsible for downloading one to two datasets from corresponding data sources. More details of the datasets are as following: 2.1 U.S. Historical Voting Results from 1976 to 2016 Dataset: 1976-2016-president.csv The dataset downloaded from Harvard Dataverse contains 14 columns and 3740 records about the voting results of presidential election by US state from 1976 to 2016. We used 4 columns from this dataset: year, state, party and candidatevotes. Table 2.1: Major columns used Column Name Description year Election Year (num) state State Name (chr) party Party Name (chr) candidatevotes Popular Votes (num) Issues with this dataset: Among the four columns that we need, the party column has a mixture of String and Boolean data. Thus we might need to do some pre-processing to uniform the data type of this column. 2.2 U.S. State Level Popular Vote Results of 2020 Presidential Election Dataset : Popular vote backend_1216.csv The dataset downloaded from Cook Political contains the 2020 Presidential Election State-Level Popular Vote Share and Result Margin. Table 2.2: Major columns used Column Name Description stateid State Postal Codes (chr) state State Name (chr) dem_votes Votes for Biden (num) rep_votes Votes for Trump (num) dem_percent Vote Percentage for Biden (num) rep_percent Vote Percentage for Trump (num) Issues with this dataset: Only the 2020 election popular voting count per candidate per state in this table are considered as the raw data. The rest of the columns in this file such as the vote margin and margin shift are calculated by Cook Political Report based on the past voting result dataset that is not published on their website. So we are not able to verify these numbers exactly using the dataset they provided. But, if necessary, we can collect the historical election popular vote outcome from other data sources (such as Harvard Dataverse) by ourselves and verify those numbers. However, since this Cook Political is a reliable data source, we would consider those values to be trustworthy and leave such verification process for future investigations. Cook Political updates their data report every day. We have updated the dataset pulled from their website on December 16th to get an up-to-date version. All of the results on the table are shown as certified and finalized. So there should be no more updates that would affect our analysis outcome. 2.3 Contribution Receipts Dataset: contribution_bind.csv The contribution receipts data on fec.gov includes all receipts filed by election candidates and committees with records of contributions made by individuals, organizations, and committees. Since contributions made in the election year seem to better reflect people’s support on their favorite candidate, we applied a date filter to select records with the receipt date falling between 01/01/2020 and 11/03/2020. Due to a huge data volume, we limited data exported to only the contributions with an amount over or equal to 200 dollars and raised by the committees of two final presidential candidates of 2020 Election. The filtered dataset was retrieved from here. The exported dataset has 78 columns and 984,824 records in total. There are 302,731 entries for Donald J. Trump for President committee and 682,093 entries for Biden for President committee. Table 2.3: Major columns used Column Name Description committee_id Recipient presidential committee id (chr) committee_name Recipient presidential committee name (chr) entity_type Contributor entity abbr. (chr) entity_type_desc Contributor entity (chr) contributor_name Full name of contributor (chr) contributor_last_name Last name of contributor (chr) contributor_city City of contributor’s address (chr) contributor_state State of contributor’s address(chr) contributor_zip Zip code of contributor’s address (chr) contributor_occupation Contributor’s occupation (chr) contribution_receipt_date Receipt date (date) contribution_receipt_amount Receipt amount (num) contributor_aggregate_ytd Contributor aggregated contribution of this year (num) Issues with this dataset: The original dataset is extremely big with over 200 million records, but many of them were very small contribubutions, therefore we filtered out records with amounts less than 200 dollars. As a result, the retrieved dataset might not capture information of all contributors, but at the same time, it largely eliminateds noise that we can focus on contributors who made significant contributions to support their favorite candidate. The dataset contains contribution amounts of negatives and zeros, which are probably relate to unsuccessful transfers. Many contributors didn’t provide all the information by some reason, so there are missing values and meaningless records in some columns like name, occupation, employer, and even city and states. Since the information was gathered based on filings of committees and campaigns, the records do not comply with a unified format. For example, the contributor suffix column has records for “JR”, “JR.”, and “JR.,” which are actually the same thing. There are also errors in the spellings of states and cities. 2.4 The Disbursements data Dataset: schedule_b-2020-11-08T16_10_30.csv The Disbursements data from fec.gov includes the operating expenditure records of House and Senate election committees, Presidential election committees, and PAC and Party committees since 2003. For this project, we filtered the data to focus on the spending of presidential election committees of 2020 US Election, which the disbursement dates are from 01/01/2020 to 11/03/2020, consistent with the scope of the contribution receipt dataset. The dataset with filters applied was exported from FEC Official Database. The retrieved dataset has 260,587 records and 78 columns. Table 2.4: Major columns used Column Name Description committee_name Presidential Committee Name (chr) disbursement_description Details of the disbursement (chr) disbursement_date Date that disbursement is made (date). disbursement_amount Amount of the disbursement (num) disbursement_purpose_category Purpose of the disbursement (chr) recipient_city City of disbursement recipient’s address (chr) recipient_zip Zip code of disbursement recipient’s address (chr) recipient_state State of disbursement recipient’s address (chr) recipient_name Entity name of disbursement recipient (chr) Issues with this dataset: The disbursement data is still getting updated with additive filings of previous disbursements being archived. The total number of records is subject to change, but the change will be trivial compared to the size of the entire dataset. Although this will not affect our analysis or overall conclusion, it is worth attention to the data incompleteness here. 2.5 Other Datasets Used We also used other auxiliary datasets to help us develop more comprehensive analysis and visualization. 2.5.1 U.S. County Level Voting Results of 2020 Presidential Election Dataset: 2020_US_County_Level_Presidential_Results.csv The dataset contains 10 columns and 3153 records covering the voting results of 2020 presidential election by US county. Since the county level data was not downloadable from the website, we exported this dataset from the github repo 2020_US_County_Level_Presidential_Results, which contains the latest voting data scraped by Tony McGovern from Fox News website. Table 2.5: Major columns used Column Name Description state_name State name (chr) county_fips The 5-digit FIPS code corresponding to the county (chr) county_name County name (chr) votes_gop Votes for Trump (num) votes_dem Votes for Biden (num) total_votes Total Votes (num) diff Difference between votes for Trump and Biden (num) per_gop Percentage of votes for Trump (num) per_dem Percentage of votes for Biden (num) per_point_diff Difference between percentages of votes for Trump and Biden (num) Issues with this dataset: This dataset is scraped from results published by from Fox News, Politico, and the New York Times. So, it is update in real time and some columns may be changed. Also, the election votes counting and post-election processing are ongoing in several states, so individual statistics we used here might change. 2.5.2 US Presidential Election vote shares Dataset: elections_historic This dataset is contained in the socviz library in R. It is a dataset of US presidential elections from 1824 to 2016, with information on the winner, runner up, and various measures of vote share. Table 2.6: Major columns used Column Name Description ec_pct Winner’s share of elctoral college vote. (Range is 0 to 1. ) (num) popular_pct Winner’s share of popular vote. (Range is 0 to 1. ) (num) Issues with this dataset As claimed in the elections_historic {socviz} documentation, the data for 2016 are provisional as of early December 2016. So we would need to update that data to include the final result of 2016 election for this project. 2.5.3 Number of Registered Voters Dataset: RegisteredVotersByState.csv We collected the dataset from World Population Review. This dataset contains the registered voter count and percentage per state. The records are all updated after June, 2020. Table 2.7: Major columns used Column Name Description state State Name (chr) totalRegistered Total number of people registered (num) Pop Total state population (num) registeredPerc Percent of peoplewho are registered voters (num) asOf Last update date (date) Issues with this dataset The data records in this file were not all updated on the same day. No other known issues with this dataset. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Election Result Data Transformation 3.2 Contribution Data Transformation 3.3 Disbursement Data Transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Most of our small auxiliary datasets have been pre-processed by data providing authorities. Hence, we will only focus on preprocessing the major four datastes in this and the following chapter. 3.1 Election Result Data Transformation In this step, we need to cleanup two election result data files: 1976-2016 historical election result and 2020 election popular vote share and vote margin. We began with cleaning the historical election result data file. First, to compare historical popular vote results for republicans on the state level, we cleaned this dataset in following steps: Select columns we needed. i.e. year, state, party and candidatevotes. Filter column party. i.e. only contains democrat and republican. Add a new column ratio, we define ratio = candidatevotes_xxx/(candidatevotes_democrat+candidatevotes_republican) Filter column party. i.e. only leave republican. Check data quality &amp; revise it We then filter out all outliers and want to revise them. Note that it involves 3 state:Utah, District of Columbia and Minnesota. After checking data, we know that Republicans have never won D.C. and popular votes have always relatively low. So, it is reasonable. However, only the share of Minnesota for Republican is abnormal. It is impossible that all voters chose one party. ## # A tibble: 27 x 4 ## year state ratio party ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1976 District of Columbia 0.832 democrat ## 2 1976 District of Columbia 0.168 republican ## 3 1980 District of Columbia 0.848 democrat ## 4 1980 District of Columbia 0.152 republican ## 5 1980 Utah 0.780 republican ## 6 1980 Utah 0.220 democrat ## 7 1984 District of Columbia 0.862 democrat ## 8 1984 District of Columbia 0.138 republican ## 9 1988 District of Columbia 0.852 democrat ## 10 1988 District of Columbia 0.148 republican ## # … with 17 more rows So, then we look back raw data. We notice that in those years, party name for Dem. is democratic-farmer-labor rather than democrat. ## # A tibble: 30 x 3 ## year party candidatevotes ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2000 democratic-farmer-labor 1168266 ## 2 2000 republican 1109659 ## 3 2000 green 126696 ## 4 2000 reform party minnesota 22166 ## 5 2000 libertarian 5282 ## 6 2000 constitution party 3272 ## 7 2000 reform party 2294 ## 8 2000 socialist workers 1022 ## 9 2000 &lt;NA&gt; 28 ## 10 2004 democratic-farmer-labor 1445014 ## # … with 20 more rows After cleaning, it contains 3 columns and 561 records. Column Description year Which election year? state State name dem_this_margin candidate votes for democrat(%) - candidate votes for republican(%) Then, we used historical U.S. presidential election data provided in the socviz library, but since the data for 2016 was provisional, we updated the 2016 data and also added the 2020 election data for our analysis. Next, we cleaned up the U.S. State Level Popular Vote Results of 2020 Presidential Election in following steps: Select columns we need. i.e. stateid, state, dem_this_margin, dem_votes, rep_votes. Add a new column class to indicate if it is States that flipped from 2016 or Democrats won, or Republicans won. We define a state as States that flipped from 2016 if it is one of Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia. Otherwise, we compared their vote for Democrats and vote for Republicans to determine their class. 3.2 Contribution Data Transformation For the contributions receipt dataset, we extracted only relevant columns as described in Data Sources Chapter. We changed the data types for several columns to factorize categorical variables like committee_name and to store contribution_receipt_date in a datetime format for later visualizations. We filtered the contributor_state column to only keep the 50 states of the US plus D.C. and eliminated noise from funds raised from foreign countries. Also, we unified different formats in the contributor_suffix column to eliminate the redundant factor levels. To better scale the contributions, we focused only on individual contributions, thus we applied the entity_type == \"IND\" to get rid of the contributions from committees, PACs, and organizations. To save file-reading time and to meet analysis and visualization needs, we made multiple aggregations on different dimensions. We derived a data frame contribution_by_date from aggregating the processed data by contribution_receipt_date, and the sum of contribution_receipt_amount was calculated for this aggregated view. Additionally, we extracted the contributors’ job titles from the column contributor_occupation, cleaned the texts following steps including: - Excluded records of uninformational or ineffective strings. For example, we got rid of records equal to “INFORMATION REQUESTED”, “-”, “NA”, “UNKNOWN”, etc. - Gathered column values to a single string separated by blank spaces. We saved some two-word job titles like “SELF EMPLOYED” and “REAL ESTATE” with underlines to avoid them being separated apart. - Inserted spaces to divide words that were sticked together. For example, records like “WRITEREDITORTEACHER” were converted to “WRITER EDITOR TEACHER” with spaces in between. - Split the string to a vector of single words. - Removed unnecessary punctuations and numbers. - Fixed detectable typos and abbreviations - Removed uninformational words stored in the stop words dataset of package tidytext. For example, words like “the”, “of”, and “and” do not add any insight but will distort the frequency distribution. Finally, the counts for each unique word were calculated and saved in a separate .csv file. 3.3 Disbursement Data Transformation The first step we did is to extract the necessary columns that are mentioned in the previous chapter. Then we noticed that in the disbursement_purpose_category, there is a OTHER top coding is dominant the dataset, hence it would not provide us lots of interesting information to analyze. Below is the original data distribution for the disbursement_purpose_category column: But since we have another column which is the disbursement_description, we can use this information to decode this top code. We examined the frequently mentioned terms in disbursement_description among those marked as OTHER and manually categorize them into existing or new categories that would fit the record type better. Below is a conversion table that we used to convert the columns. The pattern we are looking for in the description ar based on high frequent terms as well as their word stems and abbreviations. The conversion are done based on the order of this list. Table 3.1: Disbursement Description to Category Conversion Table Category Description New Category BANK|PROCESS BANKING CONSULT CONSULTING SLRY|SALARY|OFFICE|PAYROLL|PYROLL|PHONE|RENT|SOFTWARE|COMPUTER ADMINISTRATIVE MARKET|MARKETING|ADVERTISING ADVERTISING TRAVEL|TRANSPORT TRAVEL STAG|STAGING|SHIP MATERIALS EVENT|CATER|UTIL EVENTS CONTRIBUTION CONTRIBUTIONS REFUND|MILEAGE|REIMBURSE REFUNDS Here is the distribution after undo the top coding: Now, the top coding category is less significant than before. We perform our further analysis based on this cleaned data set. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Contribution Receipt Dataset", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Contribution Receipt Dataset Among the dataset we used, only the contribution receipts dataset has missing values. A total of 16,969 values were missed in 4 columns which are contribution_occupation, contribution_zip, contribution_last_name, and contribution_city. Table 4.1: Missing values column count contributor_suffix 941979 contributor_employer 17602 contributor_occupation 16915 contributor_zip 34 contributor_last_name 13 contributor_city 7 In the processed contributions dataset, missing values take 1.79% of the entire dataset consisting 946,704 observations and 12 attributes. As shown in the table and the upset plot above, the contribution_occupation column has the most missing values. It is possible that contributors might not be comfortable providing their occupation information, and the dataset has more records where the contribution_occupation column was filled with INFORMATION REQUESTED. The missingness in this column seems to be a result of the registrar accidentally not putting an INFORMATION REQUESTED tag for these records. The vertical bars of the upset plot shows patterns of missingness and their frequencies. The most popular pattern is only missing the contributor occupation information, which 16,905 entries share this pattern. Besides there are also 25 entries only missing zip code information, 13 entries only missing last name information, 9 entries missing both occupation and zip information, 6 entries only missing city information, and one entry missing both city and occupation information. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 US Presidential Election 5.2 Contribution Receipts Data 5.3 Disbursement Data Analysis", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 US Presidential Election In the U.S., a presidential candidate needs to receive a minimum of 270 out of 538 electoral votes to win the election, therefore every state matters in determining the election results. Also, with a “winner takes all” system implemented in all states except for Nebraska and Maine, popular votes are important since all the electoral votes of a state go to the candidate with the most popular votes. Based on the published voting results, we carried out extensive analysis on 2020 US Presidential Election to take a closer look at the popular votes received by two candidates on the state level. You can also go to Fox News to see detailed electoral vote results. 5.1.1 2020 Election Margins by State The first map displayed Democrats’ presidential margins, i.e. difference between Dem. vote shares and Rep. vote shares, in each state. We cut the margins by -0.5 and 0.5, but if zooming in to the Virginia-Maryland region, we can see Biden’s margin in D.C was larger than 0.5 (equal to 86.75%). Besides winning a landslide victory in D.C., Biden also won Vermont, Massachusetts, and Maryland with a margin larger than 30%, whereas Trump won Wyoming, West Virginia, North Dakota, and Oklahoma with absolute advantages. These states are clearly either blue or red, but there are also several states with a very narrow margin that are shown in the middle white color. Hot races took place in Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Michigan where the margins of the winning party were less than 5%. In general, we can see Biden’s advantage in the West Coast and the Northeast of the US while Trump’s advantage in the Southwest and the Central America. In terms of the number of states won, Biden won 26 states and Trump won 25 states, but the number of electoral votes made a big difference in the final results. Comparing election results between 2016 and 2020, we found: There were noticeable margin shifts in many states, which most of these states voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and futher expanded Democrat’s margin in 2020. The margins in Vermont and Colorado shifted the most by 9% (26.41% Dem -&gt; 35.40% Dem) and 8.6% (4.91% Dem -&gt; 13.5% Dem) respectively. Joe Biden enlarged the margins in a couple of battlegrounds that Hillary Clinton won in 2016: Minnesoda (1.52% Dem -&gt; 7.11% Dem) and New Hampshire (0.37% Dem -&gt; 7.35% Dem). Joe Biden flipped 5 states that Donald Trump won in 2016, which are displayed in the plot below. We filtered the five flipped states, and the changes in popular margins are: Michigan (0.23% Rep -&gt; 2.78% Dem), Pennsylvania (0.72% Rep -&gt; 1.16% Dem), Wisconsin (0.77% Rep -&gt; 0.63% Dem), Arizona (3.55% Rep -&gt; 0.31% Dem), and Georgia (5.13% Rep -&gt; 0.24% Dem). Among them, Georgia had the most margin shift. 5.1.2 Historical Timeline 5.1.2.1 Trace Election Margin Shifts Over Years We compared how vote shares have shifted in elections from 1976 to 2020 Instructions to use the graph: Play/pause clicking the play/pause button Play/pause by hitting space Navigate the motion slider by dragging the slider thumb Navigate the motion slider by hitting the left and right arrow keys Please refer to the wiki here for more information about motion highcharts. This motion map shows that, from 1980 to 1988, red (Republican) has dominated this map. Especially in 1984, almost all states were red(except Minnesota and note that Minnesota has always been blue from 1976 to 2020). Also, from 1992, almost all states are stable, and only few states are flipped. However, pesidential candidates of the US winning more popular votes did not always win the election. “It is possible the candidate with the most votes from the public won’t be the winner. This is because the president is not chosen directly by the voters, but what’s known as the electoral college.” (This is explained by BBC.) Thus, In this part, we compared popular vote shares vs. electoral college vote shares in US elections since 1900. Note: axes of the plot do not start from 0 as usual since we want to reduce point overlapping and zoom in to the area that contains all points of interest. From the plot above, we can see: Each point in the plot represents a winner of the US Presidential Election and the axes show the popular and electoral vote shares of the winner in the respective election year. All points fall above the horizontal line y = 50% since every president-elect obtained more than half of the electoral votes to win the election. Ideally, we hope the president-elect also had high share of popular vote. However, the data points falling in the red rectangle were not this case. There were outliers in the plot, for example, in the years 1912 and 1992, Wilson and Clinton won the election of the time with high electoral vote shares, but their popular votes shares were lower than 45%. Trump in 2016 also won the election with more electoral votes but fewer popular votes. Additionally, we can see Reagan in 1984, Roosevelt in 1936, and Nixon in 1972 won the elections with overwhelming support that their shares in both electoral votes and popular votes were very high. 5.2 Contribution Receipts Data ## [1] &quot;micromapST Ends&quot; 5.2.1 Where Contributions Came from 5.2.1.1 Overview: Total Contributions by State As an overview, we plotted the total amounts of contributions made by each state this year that were received by all presidential candidates of 2020 US election. 5.2.1.2 Biden vs. Trump: Contributions by State As shown in the map above, California has contributed the most to all presidential candidates in 2020 US Election, which exceeded 260 million US dollars. Contributions from New York, Texas, and Florida were also significant. On the other hand, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming have made the least contributions to all presidential candidates, probably because of their small populations. The bar chart above displays how much Joe Biden and Donald Trump have raised in each state in 2020, and it is sorted by the amounts of Joe Biden’s raisings. You can zoom in to see each state’s contribution amounts in detail. Joe Biden received solid support from California and New York which contributed 127M dollars and 63M dollars respectively, more than twice as contributed to Donald Trump. Besides receiving 58M dollars from California, Donald Trump also raised significant amounts from Texas and Florida equal to 52M and 48M dollars respectively, much more than Biden. We found that these are consistent with the final voting results as Biden has won California and New York with a margin larger than 20% whereas Trump won Florida and Texas, two of the battleground states. 5.2.1.3 Biden vs. Trump: Contributions Per Registered Voter by State If we instead take into account the registered voters in each state and calculate contributions per registered voter, we can see District of Columbia is clearly an outlier. It has the highest average contribution to Biden equal to 37 dollars per registered voter, way more than any other state. Remarkably, in the election Biden won 93% of total votes in DC. In addition, Wyoming surprisingly has contributed the most to Trump on an average level. After researching online, we found that Wyoming has the lowest percentage of registered voters among all states that only 47.4% of its population registered to vote, and this explains Wyoming’s higher average contribution. Its support for Trump was reflected on the voting results that Trump won the state with a margin over 40%. In fact, Biden has won all five states (DC, MA, DE, CA, and MD) listed on the left of the plot above which has made the most contributions per registered voter, and his margins of victory in these states were . Trump has won four of the five states (WY, FL, AZ, and TX) listed on the right of the plot above except for Nevada. Trump lost Nevada by 2.4% vote share. 5.2.2 Individual Contribution Distribution Table 5.1: Individual Contributions Summary by Candidate Candidate name Number of contributions Total raised amount (Million US Dollars) Mean contribution (US Dollars) Median contribution (US Dollars) BIDEN 644,429 389.6 604.62 300 TRUMP 302,275 191.4 633.24 375 Figure 5.1: Domestic Individual Contribution Distribution To see more contribution details, we selected from the original data the domestic individual contributions with amounts higher than 200 dollars received by two presidential candidates. As shown in the contributions summary table, Biden received double the number of contributions and the total amounts of funds as Trump did, but the mean and median contributions to Trump are higher than to Biden. The log10 scaled boxplot above also demonstrates the difference in median contributions, and in addition, it shows that the contributions distributions for both candidates are largely right skewed with a good number of outliers. This makes sense as the majority of individuals contributed less than 500 dollars. 5.2.3 When Contributions Were Made We also grouped data points by receipt date and calculated the daily raisings of each candidate from January 1, 2020 to October 15, 2020, which are shown as the plot above. It is clear that Joe Biden generally raised more funds than Donald Trump. We marked on the plot the major events when there were peaks in raisings of both candidates. A small peak of Biden’s raisings in the early March was prominent, and this paralleled Biden’s win in the South Carolina Democratic presidential primary along with Michael Bloomberg’s quit, which we learned from the news of the time. More notably, Biden achieved greater success in fundraising from mid-August, and Biden’s daily raisings hit the 13.6M dollars on August 20, 2020 by the time he officially accepted the Democratic nomination. On September 30, the next day of the first Presidential Debate, Joe Biden secured another huge funding of 12.2M dollars, which to some extent reflected people’s choice. Although Donald Trump also received more funds in the second half year, the contributions to Trump did not significantly increase as the election season approached. Trump’s peak in daily raisings of 4.9M dollars was reached on August 27, 2020 when he officially accepted the Republican nomination, but the amount was much less than that raised by Biden. 5.2.4 Who Contributors Were To obtain a better understanding about individual contributors, we extracted keywords from contributors occupations and separated them by candidate, so that we were able to draw a word cloud for each candidate. 5.2.4.1 50 most popular contributor occupations: Joe Biden vs. Donald Trump: To display words properly, the size of words in word clouds was scaled by extracting a cube root of the word frequency count. The blue word cloud on the left for Joe Biden clearly showed that a great proportion of contributors were not employed, and attorney, physician, engineer, and manager were also popular occupations. In contrast, the red one on the left for Trump displayed the word retired most prominently, which implied that contributors who have supported Trump were dominantly retired. Besides, entrepreneur, owner, and manager were popular occupations. We chose word clouds to provide an overview of all popular job titles, but since it is harder to judge the size of texts, we generated a bar chart below that enables better comparison between the actual frequency counts. Comparing the difference between two candidates, more than half of 10 top occupations of Joe Biden’s contributors are legal or technical professional positions, whereas more than half of 10 top occupations of Donald Trump’s contributors are positions in business. 5.3 Disbursement Data Analysis 5.3.1 Who Spent the Most Among 5 committees that spent the most during this year, 4 of them are Democratics, and only Donald Trump is Republican. This might relate to facts that the Democratic party has received more contributions than the Republican party, and also that there was little competition inside the Republican party as Trump ran for re-election. One interesting finding is that Mike Bloomberg’s Committee spend the most among all of the committees, and this is not expected since Bloomberg quit the election race very early in March 2020. According to the article from The Guardian, all of those expenditures came from Bloomberg’s personal fortune instead of campaign contributions. Therefore, we treated Mike Bloomberg’s campaign as an outlier. Joe Biden’s committee and Donald Trump’s committee were as expected the next most-spending campaigns, but Biden has spent 300 Million dollars more than Trump. 5.3.2 What They Spent Money for The stacked bar chart above shows the percentage of total disbursements spent on each category for the 5 most-spending campaigns. Committees spent the most on Advertising, while other expendituress were relatively trivial. Under the COVID-19 pandemics, candidates seemed to spend more on virtual services and canvass voters with mass public advertising rather than making campaign trips. As a result, disbursements in Travel/Events/Materials were particularly low. Also, we can see their spending strategy from the plot. Among the five candidates, Biden has spent the most, both in the proportion of total expenditures and in the dollar amount, in Advertising. On the other hand, Trump’s and Bernie’s election campaigns paid more for publicity items relative to other candidates that they prepared and purchased more campaign materials such as flyers, postcards, and pens for traditional campaign trips. Instructions to use this treemap: - Hover over a color to see spendings on a category. - Hover over a tag to see full recipient name. - Click on a color to select a spending category. Note: We tried to display the full names of companies, but many squares are small that we were not able to show names properly. However, you can move the mouse over a tag to read the full company name. Going further from what we have discovered, we created the treemap above to find which companies were the top recipients and what services they have provided. As discussed before, advertising expenses were the largest expenditures for all candidates, and media agencies like Media Assembly and Media Buying &amp; Analytics.LLC were major media buying service providers for candidates of the 2020 election. As expected, Google and Facebook were also among the top recipients as candidates largely leverage search engines and social media. There were also disbursements for administrative and consulting purposes. For example, Zenefits, Vensure HR.LLC, and ADP.LLC provide Human Resource supports like H.R. Management software systems. Presidential election committees also purchased consulting, financing, and other services to run the election, and you can click on the plot to see more details. 5.3.3 Biden vs. Trump: Disbursement Distribution Focusing on the two final presidential candidates of 2020 US Election, we took a close look at their expenditure details. Table 5.2: Disbursement Summary by Candidate Committee name Number of Records Total spending amount (Million US Dollars) Mean spending amount (US Dollars) Median spending amount (US Dollars) BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT 52,037 764.6 14,693.74 250.0 DONALD J. TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT, INC. 26,196 457.1 17,449.47 201.6 From the table above, it is clear that Biden spent 300 million dollars more than Trump. In the boxplot, we used the log10 scaled x-axis to reduce skewness of the disbursement distribution, but there are still many outliers on the right tail. Also, there are single expenditure records for both candidates with an amount larger than 10 million dollars. The median expemditures were similar for two candidates. 5.3.4 Biden vs. Trump: When they spent the most 5.3.4.1 Spending Trend of Two Committees The time series plot shows weekly spending as a percentage of total disbursements made by the two presidential committees in 2020. It is clear that both committees spent more as the election day approached. Trump election committee started in late April to invest money in campaign activities, whereas Biden did not seem to start until late May, 2020. There were some peaks in Trump’s committee spendings in early May, late June to early July, and early September to early October. Those corresponds to the cost of launching the Trump election game app, releasing digital ads to praise his policy on COVID-19 and attack Biden’s statements respectively (information source: ballotpedia.org) On the other hand, major disbursements of Biden election committee came later but grew more rapidly. The first peak in the blue trend line appears in late February to early March. According to the presidential committee activity timeline provided by ballotpedia.org, that corresponds to Biden’s first largest $12 million ad buy. Another peak of Biden’s spending trend line was in late September to early October, which the expenditures of the week took more than 13% of total disbursements this year. Comparing to Trump, Biden’s committee seeme to become more active as the election day approaches. 5.3.5 Biden vs. Trump: Disbursements by State The two maps above show how much Biden and Trump have spent in each state, and please note that the legends are in log scales. We can see the efforts they have put in some battlegrounds states, and it seems that neither of them has made significant investments to states in the central America. Biden spent the most in Georgia which was equal to 360.8 million dollars, and he also spent significant amounts in New York, California, Pennsylavania, and Massachusetts. Among these states, Biden successfully flipped and won Georgia and Pennsylavania which Democratics lost in 2016. On the other hand, Trump invested the most in Virginia, New York, New Hampshire, Louisiana, and Florida. Trump spent 347.6 million dollars in Virginia, 21.3 million dollars in New York, and 11.0 million dollars in New Hampshire. Trump’s expenditures in Virginia were more than 10 times of the amounts spent in New York, but unfortunately he lost Virginia by a 10% margin. When looking at other three flipped states Michigan, Wisconsin, and Arizona, we were surprised to find out that Trump has invested more than Biden in all three states. From this, it seems that Trump’s spending strategy was not effective in helping him win key states. His spendings on public rallies and campaign materials during a pandemic did not bring him significant votes he needed. Move To conclusion: So we raised an hypothesis that people’s expectations toward future government in this year’s election might be very dichotomize: there are states that have an absolute favor in Trump’s policy and his action toward situations happening this year, while also a group of states that counted as the majority of the vote in the election that favor Biden’s policy. Since this year is very special, we might not be able to conclude whether the expenditure data could normally have the ability to project the final voting results. In order to consolidate such hypothesis, we would need further investigations into previous expenditure and voting result. BACKUP The parallel coordinates plot on the top shows the percent of total disbursement per campaign that goes to each category. Committees spent the most on Advertising, while other spendings were relatively trivial. Under the COVID-19 pandemics, candidates seemed to spend more on virtual services and canvass voters with mass public advertising rather than making campaign trips. As shown in the plot, disbursements in Travel, Events, and Materials were particularly low. The plot on the bottom shows the same graph as the top one, but in a uniminmax scale. Compare to the plot on the top, this shows each campaign’s different focus across different expenditure categories relative to the rest of the campaign. We can see that Biden’s committee focus more on advertising, and they even spend a larger porportion of money on this category than Bloomberg. On the other hand, Trump’s committee focus more on physical advertisement such as purchasing Campaign Materials for physical events. After investigating the above graph in an interactive plot, there is no obvious correlation between each pair of the disbursement categories listed above. So we will not include the interactive parallel plot explicitly here. #### Disbursements by States Disbursement mainly goes towards the companies in the Southern and Northern-East Side of the United States. This result is consistent to 2019 Q4 U.S Real GDP data reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.Those states that are highlighted in darker red are the states that contribute more to the U.S’s GDP. For example: California, Texas, New York, Washington, Georgia. Compare to the 2020 election result, all of these states that contributes the most to the U.S total GDP, besides Taxas, voted for Joe Biden. Such pattern discontinued as we move down along the GDP level. Since the graph above includes a majority of social media and network companies, which their services can be done remotely, it would not reflect which state the candidates are focusing on to perform actions that help win the votes. On the other hand, there are two disbursement categories called MATERIALS and EVENTS that consists of the physical materials that are purchased and used locally for this presidential election, such as posters, staging materials, delivery fee, etc. If we look at the disbursement distribution across the 50 U.S. states on those categories, we might get a better idea on our previous question. In corresponding to the voting result analysis, let’s focus on the two main candidates’ committees.

You can also find code here in our github repo. This zoomable cloropleth map shows the number of votes obtained by each party/presidential candidate, their shares of votes, and margins of victory (MOV) on US county level during 2020 Presidential Election. We used the same voting results data retrieved from Fox News as described in previous sections, but formats of certain columns were changed to adapt to the plot. You can find the data here under the data folder of our repo. 6.3 Instructions for using the map The plot is initialized with a mapping of 2020 US Presidential Election votes with no default county specified. The color of each county reflects the winning party’s margin of victory, as scaled on the legend. Users can scroll up or down to manually zoom in or out the full map. Users can click and drag to move the map. Users can hover the mouse over a county to see county name, vote counts for each party, and the margin. Users can click on the county of interest, and the map will then automatically zoom in on the selected area. Notes: Since the post-election processing is onging and vote counting is not 100% completed in several states, the vote counts are subject to change. Alaska returned voting results by district but not county, so the data is reported on the state level. It may take a couple of seconds to load all features. You should be able to see a map like shown in the screenshot below.

And then we could answer those questions we proposed in the beginning. How are electoral college and popular votes different? Election result is determined by electoral college votes, not popular votes. Because of winner-take-all popular voting, it is possible that a candidate receive more popular votes but still fail in election. For example, in 2016, Hillary Clinton’s popular vote led 2.1% over than elected President Donald Trump. (If you’re instered in it, Wikipedia has posted a list of United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote). Then what’s the difference between them? The library of Congress explains it clearly: When citizens cast their ballots for president in the popular vote, they elect a slate of electors. Electors then cast the votes that decide who becomes president of the United States. How much has each campaign raised and spend this year? Raise As for state, California contributed the most to presidential candidates in 2020 (Joe Biden: 127 million dollars and Donald Trump: 58 million dollars). The difference in other states are relatively small. For example, the 2nd highest state contribition for Biden is New York (63 million dollars) and Trump is Texas (52 million dollars) Spend Did contributions and disbursement this year infer the final voting results or form a timeline reflecting on major events happened this year? Kind of. Election result isn’t completely determined by contribution amount. But if we only consider this aspect, we can still infer that Biden is more likely to win the election. From table 5.1 Contributions Summary by Candidate, we can see Biden’s total raised amount is amlost twice than Trump’s. And also in the plot of Total Disbursements By All Presidential Candidates 2020 By State, disbursement mainly goes towards New York(29), Virginia(13), Georgia(16), California(55 electoral college votes, also is a battleground state). Then we take it separately, Joe Biden Committee spent more in California, lowa while Donald Trump Committe spent more in New York(29), Florida, Louisiana and Teaxs. Potential 2020 battleground states in the presidential election between Joe Biden and Donald J. Trump include Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. But still, our analysis is limited and we still have lots of work to do. Data Limitation Like we said before, because of COVID-19, some state changed their voting policy and made it work smoothly. We can see more mail-in voting than ever. Given that, there have some claims of election fraud during the election. We’re also worried about election result data may be noisy and unreliable in this special year. We could further apply statistical test to check data. Analysis Limitation R has so many amazing visualization packages, and what we learned and used is only the tip of the iceberg. Also, we are not very familiar with U.S. election histoty and economy, so what we analysed is not in depth. In the future, when it’s available to download fully reliable and original election datasets, we will update what we did and try our best to complete a more detailed project. "]]
