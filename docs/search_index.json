In an environment of continued uncertainty, states changed their rules of voting with the objective of arranging COVID-safe elections, but the surge in absentee/mail-in ballots has inevitably extended the post-election vote counting in some states. This issue aroused continued disputes over the election integrity in the two weeks until the Associated Press finally called Joe Biden the winner of the presidential race. Donald Trump and his proxies repeatedly attacked mail voting and sowed doubts on the process and made conspiratorial claims of voting fraud, saying the election was “stolen”. Although these claims have been proven false and baseless by voting officials in both parties, we were still curious about if there exists other evidence that has provided hints of Biden’s win. Some case studies and analysis have discussed how the US economic conditions, the racial unrest, and Trump’s response to COVID-19 have impacted the odds of Trump being reelected, but we chose to focus on the public funding of the presidential election, and see if the raisings and spendings of election campaigns were linked to determining the winner of 2020 U.S. Presidential Election. In the project, we collected the voting data from The Cook Political Report as well as the presidential election committee contribution receipts and disbursements data from Federal Election Commission to generate visualizations and conduct investigations on the relationships between campaign finance and election results. We would like to carry out analysis from both geographic and time series perspectives and answer the following questions: Is there anything surprising about the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election results? How much has presidential election committees raised and spent this year? Did contributions reflect the expectations and choices of people of the United States? What were each campaign’s spending strategies and how effective were those strategies in leading the election? In the following chapters, we will discuss these questions and provide some new insights on forecasting the election outcomes.

"],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 U.S. County Level Voting Results of 2020 Presidential Election 2.2 Contribution Receipts 2.3 The Disbursements data", " Chapter 2 Data sources The primary data sources of this project are Federal Election Commission (FEC) and Fox News. FEC gathers and processes campaign finance data and discloses information about the public funding of US presidential elections. Fox News collects and verifies the election returns across the country and is an authoritative source for 2020 Presidential Election votes results. We used three major datasets: the 2020 Presidential Election Results dataset from Fox News, as well as the Contribution Receipts dataset and the Campaign Disbursements dataset from FEC. We each were responsible for downloading one dataset from its data source. More details of the datasets are as following: 2.1 U.S. County Level Voting Results of 2020 Presidential Election Dataset: 2020_US_County_Level_Presidential_Results.csv The dataset contains 10 columns and 3153 records covering the voting results of 2020 presidential election by US county. Since the county level data was not downloadable from the website, we exported this dataset from the github repo * 2020_US_County_Level_Presidential_Results*, which contains the latest voting data scraped by Tony McGovern from Fox News website. Table 2.1: Major columns used Column Name Description state_name State name (chr) county_fips The 5-digit FIPS code corresponding to the county (chr) county_name County name (chr) votes_gop Votes for Trump (num) votes_dem Votes for Biden (num) total_votes Total Votes (num) diff Difference between votes for Trump and Biden (num) per_gop Percentage of votes for Trump (num) per_dem Percentage of votes for Biden (num) per_point_diff Difference between percentages of votes for Trump and Biden (num) Issues with this dataset: This dataset is scraped from results published by from Fox News, Politico, and the New York Times. So, it is update in real time and some columns may be changed. Also, the election votes counting and post-election processing are ongoing in several states, so individual statistics we used here might change. 2.2 Contribution Receipts Dataset: contribution_bind.csv The contribution receipts data on fec.gov includes all receipts filed by election candidates and committees with records of contributions made by individuals, organizations, and committees. Since contributions made in the election year seem to better reflect people’s support on their favorite candidate, we applied a date filter to select records with the receipt date falling between 01/01/2020 and 11/03/2020. Due to a huge data volume, we limited data exported to only the contributions with an amount over or equal to 200 dollars and raised by the committees of two final presidential candidates of 2020 Election. The filtered dataset was retrieved from here. The exported dataset has 79 columns and 984,824 records in total. There are 302,731 entries for Donald J. Trump for President committee and 682,093 entries for Biden for President committee.

As a result, the retrieved dataset might not capture information of all contributors, but at the same time, it largely eliminateds noise that we can focus on contributors who made significant contributions to support their favorite candidate. The dataset contains contribution amounts of negatives and zeros, which are probably relate to unsuccessful transfers. Many contributors didn’t provide all the information by some reason, so there are missing values and meaningless records in some columns like name, occupation, employer, and even city and states. Since the information was gathered based on filings of committees and campaigns, the records do not comply with a unified format. For example, the contributor suffix column has records for “JR”, “JR.”, and “JR.,” which are actually the same thing. There are also errors in the spellings of states and cities. 2.3 The Disbursements data Dataset: schedule_b-2020-11-08T16_10_30.csv The Disbursements data from fec.gov includes the operating expenditure records of House and Senate election committees, Presidential election committees, and PAC and Party committees since 2003. For this project, we filtered the data to focus on the spending of presidential election committees of 2020 US Election, which the disbursement dates are from 01/01/2020 to 11/03/2020, consistent with the scope of the contribution receipt dataset. The dataset with filters applied was exported from FEC Official Database. The retrieved dataset has 260,587 records and 78 columns.

The total number of records is subject to change, but the change will be trivial compared to the size of the entire dataset. Although this will not affect our analysis or overall conclusion, it is worth attention to the data incompleteness here. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Election Result Data Transformation 3.2 Contribution Data Transformation 3.3 Disbursement Data Transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Election Result Data Transformation First, to compare historical popular vote results for republicans on the state level, we cleaned this dataset in following steps: Select columns we needed. i.e. year, state, party and candidatevotes. Filter column party. i.e. only contains democrat and republican. Add a new column ratio, we define ratio = candidatevotes_xxx/(candidatevotes_democrat+candidatevotes_republican) Filter column party. i.e. only leave republican. Check data quality &amp; revise it We then filter out all outliers and want to revise them. Note that it involves 2 state: District of Columbia and Minnesota. After checking data, we know that Republicans have never won D.C. and popular votes have always relatively low. So, it is reasonable. However, the share of Minnesota for Republican is abnormal. It is impossible that all voters chose one party. ## # A tibble: 14 x 3 ## year state ratio ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1976 District of Columbia 0.168 ## 2 1980 District of Columbia 0.152 ## 3 1984 District of Columbia 0.139 ## 4 1988 District of Columbia 0.148 ## 5 1992 District of Columbia 0.0970 ## 6 1996 District of Columbia 0.0988 ## 7 2000 District of Columbia 0.0951 ## 8 2000 Minnesota 1 ## 9 2004 District of Columbia 0.0948 ## 10 2004 Minnesota 1 ## 11 2008 District of Columbia 0.0660 ## 12 2012 District of Columbia 0.0741 ## 13 2012 Minnesota 1 ## 14 2016 District of Columbia 0.0430 So, then we look back raw data. We notice that in those years, party name for Dem. is democratic-farmer-labor rather than democrat. ## # A tibble: 30 x 3 ## year party candidatevotes ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2000 democratic-farmer-labor 1168266 ## 2 2000 republican 1109659 ## 3 2000 green 126696 ## 4 2000 reform party minnesota 22166 ## 5 2000 libertarian 5282 ## 6 2000 constitution party 3272 ## 7 2000 reform party 2294 ## 8 2000 socialist workers 1022 ## 9 2000 &lt;NA&gt; 28 ## 10 2004 democratic-farmer-labor 1445014 ## # … with 20 more rows After cleaning, it contains 3 columns and 561 records. Column Description year Which election year? state State name ratio Share of popular votes for Rep. Then, we used historical U.S. presidential election data provided in the socviz library, but since the data for 2016 was provisional, we updated the 2016 data and also added the 2020 election data for our analysis. 3.2 Contribution Data Transformation For the contributions receipt dataset, we extracted only relevant columns as described in Data Sources Chapter. We changed the data types for several columns to factorize categorical variables like committee_name and to store contribution_receipt_date in a datetime format for later visualizations. We filtered the contributor_state column to only keep the 50 states of the US plus D.C. and eliminated noise from funds raised from foreign countries. Also, we unified different formats in the contributor_suffix column to eliminate the redundant factor levels. To better scale the contributions, we focused only on individual contributions, thus we applied the entity_type == \"IND\" to get rid of the contributions from committees, PACs, and organizations. To save file-reading time and to meet analysis and visualization needs, we made multiple aggregations on different dimensions. We derived a data frame contribution_by_date from aggregating the processed data by contribution_receipt_date, and the sum of contribution_receipt_amount was calculated for this aggregated view. Additionally, we extracted the contributors’ job titles from the column contributor_occupation, cleaned the texts following steps including: - Excluded records of uninformational or ineffective strings. For example, we got rid of records equal to “INFORMATION REQUESTED”, “-”, “NA”, “UNKNOWN”, etc. - Gathered column values to a single string separated by blank spaces. We saved some two-word job titles like “SELF EMPLOYED” and “REAL ESTATE” with underlines to avoid them being separated apart. - Inserted spaces to divide words that were sticked together. For example, records like “WRITEREDITORTEACHER” were converted to “WRITER EDITOR TEACHER” with spaces in between. - Split the string to a vector of single words. - Removed unnecessary punctuations and numbers. - Fixed detectable typos and abbreviations - Removed uninformational words stored in the stop words dataset of package tidytext. For example, words like “the”, “of”, and “and” do not add any insight but will distort the frequency distribution. Finally, the counts for each unique word were calculated and saved in a separate .csv file. 3.3 Disbursement Data Transformation The first step we did is to extract the necessary columns that are mentioned in the previous chapter. Then we noticed that in the disbursement_purpose_category, there is a OTHER top coding is dominant the dataset, hence it would not provide us lots of interesting information to analyze. Below is the original data distribution for the disbursement_purpose_category column: But since we have another column which is the disbursement_description, we can use this information to decode this top code. We examined the frequently mentioned terms in disbursement_description among those marked as OTHER and manually categorize them into existing or new categories that would fit the record type better. Below is a conversion table that we used to convert the columns. The pattern we are looking for in the description ar based on high frequent terms as well as their word stems and abbreviations. The conversion are done based on the order of this list. Table 3.1: Disbursement Description to Category Conversion Table Category Description New Category BANK|PROCESS BANKING CONSULT CONSULTING SLRY|SALARY|OFFICE|PAYROLL|PYROLL|PHONE|RENT|SOFTWARE|COMPUTER ADMINISTRATIVE MARKET|MARKETING|ADVERTISING ADVERTISING TRAVEL|TRANSPORT TRAVEL STAG|STAGING|SHIP MATERIALS EVENT|CATER|UTIL EVENTS CONTRIBUTION CONTRIBUTIONS REFUND|MILEAGE|REIMBURSE REFUNDS Here is the distribution after undo the top coding: Now, the top coding category is less significant than before. We perform our further analysis based on this cleaned data set. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Contribution Receipt Dataset", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Contribution Receipt Dataset The election voting results and the disbursements datasets do not have missing values, however, the contribution receipts dataset has 275 values missed in some columns. Table 4.1: Missing values x contributor_suffix 941979 contributor_employer 17602 contributor_occupation 16915 contributor_zip 34 contributor_last_name 13 contributor_city 7 In the processed contributions dataset, missing values only take 0.21% of the entire dataset with 946,704 observations of 14 attributes. As shown in the table and the upset plot above, missing values of the contributions dataset most frequently appear in columns including contributor_employer, contributor_zip, and contributor_occupation. The most popular pattern of missingness is only missing the contributor employer information, which 143 entries share this pattern. Besides there are also 35 entries missing both occupation and employer information, and 34 entries missing zip code information. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Election Vote Results Visualizations 5.2 Contribution Receipts Data 5.3 Disbursement Data Analysis", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Election Vote Results Visualizations 5.1.1 State level From this plot, it’s easy to see that Biden won most of the votes in the eastern and western regions of the United States, while Trump’s votes are mainly from the central region. In terms of the number of winning states, they are not much different, but we need to consider that the number of electoral votes is different. Also, we compared election results between 2016 and 2020 on the state level, and we found: - Joe Biden flipped 5 states from Donald Trump. i.e Michigan(0.23%R -&gt; 2.78%D), Pennsylvania(0.72%R -&gt; 1.16%D), Wisconsin(0.77%R -&gt; 0.63D), Arizona(3.55%R -&gt; 0.31%D), Georgia(5.13%R -&gt; 0.24%D). Joe Biden enlarged the margin of Minnesoda(1.52%D -&gt; 7.11%D) and New Hampshire(0.37%D -&gt; 7.35%D) that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. 5.1.2 Time level Instructions to Use the Graph play/pause clicking the play/pause button play/pause by hitting space navigating the motion slider by dragging the slider thumb navigating the motion slider by hitting the left and right arrow keys In this part, I will compare popular vote and electoral college vote from 1824 to 2020 (Note that Data for 2020 are provisonal, collected in 5 Dec). It’s possible the candidate with the most votes from the public won’t be the winner. This is because the president is not chosen directly by the voters, but what’s known as the electoral college. (This explained by BBC ) From this plot, we can see: Ideally, we may think the president also have high share of popular vote. Those data in the red rectangular shows not this case. This can be explained by how the US presidential election works. Adams 1824 may be regarded as an outlier. However, after looking up Wiki, He is actually from Democratic-Republican Party. Finally, we can regard Roosevelt as an outstanding candidate since his electoral vote and popular vote are very high. 5.2 Contribution Receipts Data 5.2.1 Overview 5.2.1.1 Total Contributions by State As an overview, we plotted the total amounts of contributions made by each state this year that were received by all presidential candidates of 2020 US election. As shown in the map above, California has contributed the most to all presidential candidates in 2020 US Election, which exceeded 260 million US dollars. Contributions from New York, Texas, and Florida were also significant. On the other hand, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming have made the least contributions to all presidential candidates, probably because of their small populations. The bar chart above focuses on the total amounts raised from each state by the final presidential candidates Joe Biden and Donald Trump, and it displays top 5 states that contributed the most to each candidate. Joe Biden received solid support from California and New York which contributed 127M dollars and 63M dollars respectively, more than twice as contributed to Donald Trump. Donald Trump raised significant amounts from Texas and Florida equal to 52M and 48M dollars respectively, much more than Biden. This is consistent with the voting results as Biden has won in both states with a margin larger than 20%. We found that these are consistent with the final voting results as Biden has won California and New York with a margin larger than 20% whereas Trump won Florida and Texas, two of the battleground states. 5.2.1.2 Contributions Per Registered Voter by State If we instead take into account the registered voters in each state and calculate contributions per registered voter, we found that District of Columbia has the highest average contribution to Biden, which is 37 dollars per registered voter, way more than any other state. Remarkably, in the election Biden won 93% of total votes in DC. In addition, Wyoming surprisingly has contributed the most to Trump on an average level. Wyoming has the lowest percentage of registered voters among all states that only 47.4% of its population registered to vote, and its support for Trump was reflected on the voting results as Trump won the state with a margin over 40%. In fact, Biden has won all five states (DC, MA, DE, CA, and MD) listed on the left of the plot above which has made the most contributions per registered voter, and his margins of victory in these states were . Trump has won four of the five states (WY, FL, AZ, and TX) listed on the right of the plot above except for Nevada. Trump lost Nevada by 2.4% vote share. 5.2.2 Contributions Distribution and Details Table 5.1: Contributions Summary by Candidate Candidate name Number of contributions Total raised amount (US Dollars) Mean contribution (US Dollars) Median contribution (US Dollars) BIDEN 644,429 389,633,952 604.62 300 TRUMP 302,275 191,411,975 633.24 375 Figure 5.1: Domestic Individual Contribution Distribution To see more contribution details, we selected from the original data the domestic individual contributions with amounts higher than 200 dollars received by two presidential candidates. As shown in the contributions summary table, Biden received double the number of contributions and the total amounts of funds as Trump did, but the mean and median contributions to Trump are higher than to Biden. The log10 scaled boxplot above also demonstrates the difference in median contributions, and in addition, it shows that the contributions distributions for both candidates are largely right skewed with a good number of outliers. This makes sense as the majority of individuals contributed less than 500 dollars. 5.2.3 Contributions by Date: Time Series We also grouped data points by receipt date and calculated the daily raisings of each candidate from January 1, 2020 to October 15, 2020, which are shown as the plot above. It is clear that Joe Biden generally raised more funds than Donald Trump. We marked on the plot the major events when there were peaks in raisings of both candidates. A small peak of Biden’s raisings in the early March was prominent, and this paralleled Biden’s win in the South Carolina Democratic presidential primary along with Michael Bloomberg’s quit, which we learned from the news of the time. More notably, Biden achieved greater success in fundraising from mid-August, and Biden’s daily raisings hit the 13.6M dollars on August 20, 2020 by the time he officially accepted the Democratic nomination. On September 30, the next day of the first Presidential Debate, Joe Biden secured another huge funding of 12.2M dollars, which to some extent reflected people’s choice. Although Donald Trump also received more funds in the second half year, the contributions to Trump did not significantly increase as the election season approached. Trump’s peak in daily raisings of 4.9M dollars was reached on August 27, 2020 when he officially accepted the Republican nomination, but the amount was much less than that raised by Biden. 5.2.4 Contributor Occupations To obtain a better understanding about individual contributors, we extracted keywords from contributors occupations and separated them by candidate, so that we were able to draw word a cloud for each candidate. 5.2.4.1 50 most popular contributor occupations: Joe Biden vs. Donald Trump: To display words properly, the size of words in word clouds was scaled by extracting a cube root of the word frequency count. The blue word cloud on the left for Joe Biden clearly showed that a great proportion of contributors were not employed, and attorney, physician, engineer, and manager were also popular occupations. In contrast, the red one on the left for Trump displayed the word retired most prominently, which implied that contributors who have supported Trump were dominantly retired. Besides, entrepreneur, owner, and manager were popular occupations. We chose word clouds to provide an overview of all popular job titles, but since it is harder to judge the size of texts, we generated a bar chart below that enables better comparison between the actual frequency counts. Comparing the difference between two candidates, more than half of 10 top occupations of Joe Biden’s contributors are legal or technical professional positions, whereas more than half of 10 top occupations of Donald Trump’s contributors are jobs in business. 5.3 Disbursement Data Analysis 5.3.1 Disbursement Distribution Table 5.2: Disbursement Summary by Candidate Candidate name Number of Records Total disbursed amount (US Dollars) Mean disbursement amount (US Dollars) Median disbursement amount (US Dollars) BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT 52,037 764,617,908 14,693.74 250.0 DONALD J. TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT, INC. 26,196 457,106,376 17,449.47 201.6 Every expenditure made by Trump Committee are evenly spread out from 0 to less than a million. The distribution is a little left skewed. There are more outliers clustering at the higher expenditure level than lower expenditure level. On the other hand, Biden Committee has their expenditure distribution centered symmetrically around their median. The range of Biden Committee’s single expenditure is wider than Trump Committee. There are more outliers densely clustering at the higher expenditure level, which means Biden Committee’s made more large transactions than Trump Committee. 5.3.2 Top 5 Presidential Campaign Made the Most Disbursement The above graph shows 5 committees with the most disbursement made. Among these 5 committees, 4 of them are Democratics, 1 of them is Republican. One fact that might lead to this result could be that the Democratic parties are receiving more contributions than the Republican party in this election. One interesting finding is that Mike Bloomberg’s Committee spend the most among all of the committees. This is not expected since Bloomberg quit the election race early in March 2020. According to the article from The Guardian, all of those expenditures are from Bloomberg’s personal fortune, and not from campaign contribution. Therefore, the spending made by Mike Bloomberg’s campaign is definitely an outlier. Next, Joe Biden’s committee and Donald Trump’s committee gets the second and third place on the list, and this is what is expected since they are the main candidates in this election. We can see that this distribution is following an exponential trend. Each committee spends about twice more than the committee that is ranked after it. 5.3.3 Disbursement Details The graph on the top shows the percent of total disbursement per campaign that goes to each category. The three areas that most of the committees focus on more are Administrative, Advertising, and Consulting. Those categories are which the services could be provided virtually. Compare to those categories, disbursements in Travel, Events, and Materials are relatively low. Since those categories require in-person meetings and activities, this trend could be caused by the COVID pandemics this year. There are also other categories such as banking, contributions, transfers, etc, which do not constitutes a majority part of the expenditure and are related to each campaign’s unique financial management activities. Since those categories are not in the scope of this research, we will not discuss those categories in detail here. The graph on the bottom shows the same graph on the top, but in a uniminmax scale. Compare to the above graph, this shows each campaign’s different focus across different expenditure categories relative to the rest of the campaign. We can see that Biden’s committee focus more on advertising, and they even spend a larger porportion of money on this category than Bloomberg. On the other hand, Trump’s committee focus more on physical advertisement such as purchasing Campaign Materials for physical events. After investigating the above graph in an interactive plot, there is no obvious correlation between each pair of the disbursement categories listed above. So we will not include the interactive parallel plot explicitly here. 5.3.4 When does those committee spend the most? 5.3.4.1 Spending Trend of Two Major Committees The above graph shows a percentage of total disbursement made per week by the two presidential committee in 2020. From the above graph, we can see both of the committees are spending more and more as election day approaches.There are some spending trend fluctuation in early 2020, but such fluctuation evens out as time goes on.Trump’s committee (represented by the red trend line in the graph) started earlier than Biden’s committee to invest money in activities regards this election. We can see this in the part of trend in January and the mass investment starting in April. Trump’s committee spending trend has three peaks in the graph, which are in early May, late June to early July, and early September to early October. Those corresponds to the cost of launching the Trump election game app, release of digital ads for praising his policy on COVID and attacking Biden’s statement correspondingly (information source: ballotpedia.org) On the other hand, Biden’s committee (represented by the blue trend line in the graph) started their disbursement later but the total disbursement grows more rapidly. The first peak in the blue trend line appears in late February to early March. According to the presidential committee activity timeline provided by ballotpedia.org, that corresponds to Biden’s first largest $12 million ad buy. There is another peak in Biden’s committee spending trend line which is in late September to early October. Comparing to Trump’s committee trend line that looks evenly distributed across that period of time, Biden’s committee became more active as the election day approaches. 5.3.5 Disbursement Recipient Share This graph matches what we have discovered before. Most of the committees focus on advertising to help them win the election. Media Assembly and Media Buying &amp; Analytics.LLC are two major companies that provides media advertising services to the 2020 election. As expected, there are also some large tech companies like Google and Facebook in this section. There are also many disbursements for administrative and consulting purposes. Administrative and consulting are the next two largest sectors. They get about equal share of the total disbursements. Zenefits, Vensure HR.LLC, ADP.LLC are three major recipients in the Administrative section. All of these three companies provides Human Resource supports such as H.R. Management software system. In the Consulting section, we see data analytics and financial consulting companies such as Hawkfish.LLC and Geller &amp; Company.LLC. In Other section, there are banks, tech service companies, as well as Vensure HR.LLC and Hawkfish.LLC that we have seen earlier. Though we are unable to specify which purpose those disbursements are for, it is highly likely that those disbursements would be related to financial and other minor transactions regarding the services committees purchased from those supporting companies. 5.3.6 Where Does All of The Disbursement Money Go? We are going to visualize the disbursement distribution across the 50 states in U.S in the next step: Disbursement mainly goes towards the companies on the Southern and Northern-East Side of the United States. This result is consistent to 2019 Q4 U.S Real GDP data reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.Those states that are highlighted in darker red are the states that contribute more to the U.S’s GDP. For example: California, Texas, New York, Washington, Georgia. Compare to the 2020 election result, all of these states that contributes the most to the U.S total GDP, besides Taxas, voted for Joe Biden. Such pattern discontinued as we move down along the GDP level. Since the graph above includes a majority of social media and network companies, which their services can be done remotely, it would not reflect which state the candidates are focusing on to perform actions that help win the votes. On the other hand, there are two disbursement categories called MATERIALS and EVENTS that consists of the physical materials that are purchased and used locally for this presidential election, such as posters, staging materials, delivery fee, etc. If we look at the disbursement distribution across the 50 U.S. states on those categories, we might get a better idea on our previous question. In corresponding to the voting result analysis, let’s focus on the two main candidates’ committees. There are not a lot of physical events going on and propaganda passing out for this year’s election. Partly it could due to the COVID pandemic. From the above graph, the location where Trump’s committee held physical events are more widely spread out across U.S than Biden’s committee, especially in the middle part of the U.S. Meanwhile, the recipients of material and event fee made by Biden’s committee mainly clustered in the east half of the U.S. and West Coast. As shown previously in the parallel axis graph, both of the committees spent less than 5% of their total expenditure in Materials and Events in total. Compare both maps above, we can see more regions colored in bright red in the second map, but not that much on the first map. Those bright colors represent that those regions are receiving more of such committee’s total disbursement. The two maps are colored based on the same color scale. Since we have found that Biden’s committee spent more than Trump’s Committee, and Trump’s committee is spending more in the above two categories, it is not difficult to conclude that Trump’s committee spent a larger percent of their total expenditure in physical events. This could be one of the campaign’s strategy, since there are many states that Trump invested for physical events turned out voting Trump this year. But such strategy does not necessarily guarantee them to win the election under this year’s circumstance. Among the five flipped states that voted for Biden this year, Biden’s committee spend more in physical events in two of them: Michigan and Georgia, and Trump’s committee spend more in physical events in the rest three states: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Arizona. Also, Biden did not spend as much as Trump did on physical events this year overall. So we raised an hypothesis that people’s expectations toward future government in this year’s election might be very dichotomize: there are states that have an absolute favor in Trump’s policy and his action toward situations happening this year, while also a group of states that counted as the majority of the vote in the election that favor Biden’s policy. Since this year is very special, we might not be able to conclude whether the expenditure data could normally have the ability to project the final voting results. In order to consolidate such hypothesis, we would need further investigations into previous expenditure and voting result.

You can also find code here in our github repo. This interactive map shows the number of votes obtained by each party/presidential candidate, their shares of votes, and margins of victory (MOV) on US county level during 2020 Presidential Election. We used the same voting results data retrieved from Fox News as described in previous sections, but formats of certain columns were changed to adapt to the plot. You can find the data here under the data folder of our repo. 6.1.2 Instructions for using the map: The plot is initialized with a mapping of 2020 US Presidential Election votes with no default county specified. The color of each county reflects the winning party’s margin of victory, as scaled on the legend. 1. Users can scroll up or down to manually zoom in or out the full map. 2. Users can click and drag to move the map. 3. Users can hover the mouse over a county to see county name, vote counts for each party, and the margin. 4. Users can select the county of interest by clicking the county on the map. The map will then automatically zoom in on the selected area. Notes: Since the post-election processing is onging and vote counting is not 100% completed in several states, the vote counts are subject to change. Alaska did not return voting results by county, so the data is reported on the state level.

And then we could answer those questions we proposed in the beginning. How are electoral college and popular votes different? Election result is determined by electoral college votes, not popular votes. Because of winner-take-all popular voting, it is possible that a candidate receive more popular votes but still fail in election. For example, in 2016, Hillary Clinton’s popular vote led 2.1% over than elected President Donald Trump. (If you’re instered in it, Wikipedia has posted a list of United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote). Then what’s the difference between them? The library of Congress explains it clearly: When citizens cast their ballots for president in the popular vote, they elect a slate of electors. Electors then cast the votes that decide who becomes president of the United States. How much has each campaign raised and spend this year? Raise As for state, California contributed the most to presidential candidates in 2020 (Joe Biden: 127 million dollars and Donald Trump: 58 million dollars). The difference in other states are relatively small. For example, the 2nd highest state contribition for Biden is New York (63 million dollars) and Trump is Texas (52 million dollars) Spend Did contributions and disbursement this year infer the final voting results or form a timeline reflecting on major events happened this year? Kind of. Election result isn’t completely determined by contribution amount. But if we only consider this aspect, we can still infer that Biden is more likely to win the election. From table 5.1 Contributions Summary by Candidate, we can see Biden’s total raised amount is amlost twice than Trump’s. And also in the plot of Total Disbursements By All Presidential Candidates 2020 By State, disbursement mainly goes towards New York(29), Virginia(13), Georgia(16), California(55 electoral college votes, also is a battleground state). Then we take it separately, Joe Biden Committee spent more in California, lowa while Donald Trump Committe spent more in New York(29), Florida, Louisiana and Teaxs. Potential 2020 battleground states in the presidential election between Joe Biden and Donald J. Trump include Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. But still, our analysis is limited and we still have lots of work to do. Data Limitation Like we said before, because of COVID-19, some state changed their voting policy and made it work smoothly. We can see more mail-in voting than ever. Given that, there have some claims of election fraud during the election. We’re also worried about election result data may be noisy and unreliable in this special year. We could further apply statistical test to check data. Analysis Limitation R has so many amazing visualization packages, and what we learned and used is only the tip of the iceberg. Also, we are not very familiar with U.S. election histoty and economy, so what we analysed is not in depth. In the future, when it’s available to download fully reliable and original election datasets, we will update what we did and try our best to complete a more detailed project. "]]
