# Conclusion

**draft**

After completing this project, our team has a better understanding of the  U.S. President Election. And then we could answer those questions we proposed in the beginning.

**How are electoral college and popular votes different?**

Election result is determined by electoral college votes, not popular votes. 

Because of winner-take-all popular voting, it is possible that a candidate receive more popular votes but still fail in election. For example, in 2016, Hillary Clinton's popular vote led 2.1% over than elected President Donald Trump. (If you're instered in it, Wikipedia has posted a [list of United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_elections_in_which_the_winner_lost_the_popular_vote)). 

Then what's the difference between them? [*The library of Congress*](https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/elections/presidential-election-process/what-is-the-electoral-college/) explains it clearly: *When citizens cast their ballots for president in the popular vote, they elect a slate of electors. Electors then cast the votes that decide who becomes president of the United States*.


**How much has each campaign raised and spend this year?**

- Raise

As for state, **California** contributed the most to presidential candidates in 2020 (Joe Biden: 127 million dollars and Donald Trump: 58 million dollars). The difference in other states are relatively small. For example, the 2nd highest state contribition for Biden is New York (63 million dollars) and Trump is Texas (52 million dollars) 

- Spend



**Did contributions and disbursement this year infer the final voting results or form a timeline reflecting on major events happened this year?**

Kind of. Election result isn't completely determined by contribution amount. But if we only consider this aspect, we can still infer that Biden is more likely to win the election. 

From *table 5.1 Contributions Summary by Candidate*, we can see Biden's total raised amount is amlost twice than Trump's. And also in the plot of *Total Disbursements By All Presidential Candidates 2020 By State*, disbursement mainly goes towards New York(29), Virginia(13), Georgia(16), California(55 electoral college votes, also is a battleground state). 

Then we take it separately, Joe Biden Committee spent more in California, lowa while Donald Trump Committe spent more in New York(29), Florida, Louisiana
and Teaxs. 

Potential 2020 battleground states in the presidential election between Joe Biden and Donald J. Trump include Arizona, Florida, Georgia,  Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.



But still, our analysis is limited and we still have lots of work to do.

**Data Limitation**

Like we said before, because of COVID-19, some state changed their voting policy and made it work smoothly. We can see more mail-in voting than ever. Given that, there have some claims of election fraud during the election. We're also worried about election result data may be noisy and unreliable in this special year. We could further apply statistical test to check data. 

**Analysis Limitation**

R has so many amazing visualization packages, and what we learned and used is only the tip of the iceberg. Also, we are not very familiar with U.S. election histoty and economy, so what we analysed is not in depth.

In the future, when it's available to download fully reliable and original election datasets, we will update what we did and try our best to complete a more detailed project.
